title: About the Biodiversity RCN
---

For five years, this RCN will bring together highly productive and collaborative scientists from three major fields (biology, environmental sciences, and computer sciences) to promote synthesis and advance documentation and prediction of biodiversity patterns and the ecosystem functions linked to biodiversity. The network seeks to promote theoretical advances about cross-scale interactions and their feedbacks on biodiversity structuring and services. Key to this endeavor is the need to integrate and visualize the multiple complex links across biological and environmental data, which raises computational and data management challenges that will be identified, discussed, and, to the extent possible, addressed. Thanks to NSF, we can support yearly meetings, cross-lab collaborations, and student exchanges. Our focal areas are:

1. Drivers of biodiversity patterns across space, time, and hierarchical scales of biological organization (genotype, phenotype, populations, communities, and ecosystems), particularly emphasizing how cross-scale processes structure biodiversity patterns and the ecosystem functions they provide.
2. Biodiversity detection and novel monitoring approaches that can provide a window into patterns and processes acting at multiple biological, spatial, and temporal scales, particularly through the use of proximal and remote sensing methods with high spectral and spatial resolution, linked to ground-level biodiversity inventories.
3. Bioinformatics and cyberinfrastructure, to promote new ways to handle storage, integration, and visualization of complex biological and environmental data across scales.
4. Scientific communication, including training opportunities and discussions of novel approaches to enhance public awareness about the complexity, value and role of biodiversity.

Our first meeting will be hosted by The University of Minnesota and the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, June 10-15, 2018. Subsequent meetings will be held in Florida and NYC.
