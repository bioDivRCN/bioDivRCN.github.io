## Historical contingencies and evolutionary constraints on ecosystem properties

For remotely sensed ecosystem function (in a snapshot or through time across, e.g., drought events) are annomolies in correlative relationships between function and abiotic environment explained by historical contingency and/or evolutionary drivers?

Workflow:
- document ecosystem function
- look at historical biogeography of the areas
- look for key missing or present clades 
- look at phylogenetic comm ecol (using Rampal's null)
- which timescales are relevant to explaining contemporary ecosystem patterns/function
- look at assembly process via fitting null/neutral theories (Harte/Hubbell) and ask if deviations from theory (and/or differences in parameter space occupation) correlate with deviations in ecosystem function
- model demographic responses to climate change using Mike's phylogeographic approach
- consider human impact as a covariate

Do a similar thing for, e.g., body size and/or trophic structure of all vertabrates or vertabrate lineages (like just birds)

Data:
- map of life for vertabrates and their traits
- BBS for birds
- FIA for trees
- Forest GEO for trees
- sPlot
- BIEN
- TRY
- incidental data if we can account for collection bias
- others?
- phylogenies from OpenTree
- remotely sensed ecosystem function
- remotely sensed human impact
- remotely sensed traits


## Have humans erased the role of evolution in driving ecosystem properties
- are there gradients in human impact and restoration (both extent and timing) that can be looked at in combination with evolution?
- for example is there a gradient across space where pioneers started farming?
